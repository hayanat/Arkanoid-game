# Arkanoid (BrickerGameManager)

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Haya Natsheh, and together with Adan Irshead, we developed BrickerGameManager as part of our coursework for "67125 Introduction to Object Oriented" at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. We leveraged the DanoGameLab game engine framework to implement and manage game objects dynamically.

## Game Overview

BrickerGameManager challenges players with a paddle and a bouncing ball tasked with breaking bricks at the top of the screen. The game increases in difficulty with various levels, introducing different behaviors for the bricks, such as spawning additional balls, camera effects, and adding extra paddles.

## Features

- **Multi-level gameplay**: Progressively challenging scenarios.
- **Dynamic collision handling**: Utilizing the DanoGameLab framework.
- **Special brick behaviors**: Including multiple ball spawns and camera effects.
- **Simple and intuitive user interface**: Ensuring maximum playability.
