BrickerGameManager:
Hello! I'm Haya Natsheh , and together with Adan Irshead, we developed BrickerGameManager as part of our coursework for "67125-1 Introduction to Object Oriented - 1" at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
leveraging the DanoGameLab game engine framework to implement and manage game objects dynamically.

Game Overview:
BrickerGameManager challenges players with a paddle and a bouncing ball tasked with breaking bricks at the top of the screen.
The game increases in difficulty with various levels, introducing different behaviors for the bricks, such as spawning additional balls, camera effects and adding extra paddle.

Features:
Multi-level gameplay with progressively challenging scenarios.
Dynamic collision handling using the DanoGameLab framework.
Special brick behaviors like multiple ball spawns and camera effects.
Simple and intuitive user interface for maximum playability.
